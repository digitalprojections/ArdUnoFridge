# ArdUnoFridge
arduino projects


This is an arduino based fridge fix project. 
Our fridge broke down and parts replacement was not an option, probably because the thing was old.
Fixing it or trying to make it work more or less closely resembling the actual functionality, I decided to use Arduino UNO laying around.

The project complete with the fridge running into freeze outs in summer and needing occationals meltdowns.
All in all it is working fine
